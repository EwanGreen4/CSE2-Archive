None of us are lawyers, but to my understanding...

Being a decompilation, much of CSE2's code belongs to Daisuke "Pixel" Amaya.
There was no licence supplied with the original freeware release, so presumably
this code defaults to 'All Rights Reserved'.

...I dunno - how many of *you* are fluent in international copyright law?


====================================
= Aeon Genesis Translation Project =
====================================

The English translation of Cave Story used here was created by Aeon Genesis.

There doesn't appear to be any particular licence supplied with the translation,
so it's likely all-rights-reserved.

The supplied readme does contain these details:


"Copyright 2005 Aeon Genesis"

Special Thanks to...
--Shih Tzu, for facilitating contact with Pixel himself
--Pixel himself, for creating the game, allowing us to produce an
  English version of it, and for putting up with what must have
  seemed an awful amount of nagging questions on my part :) You've
  got the patience of a saint, and this wouldn't be done without
  you!
--sandcrab, who produced an alternate translation of the text for
  Pixel. It is, as yet, unpublished.
--Tomato & Bugcatcher, for helping out on a couple tough bits in
  the text. Cheers!

Currently we don't have a licence for our code. But, considering CSE2 is
intended for modders, you can probably get away with using it for that without
any of us getting mad over it.

It might be worth crediting us, just to be safe - I (Clownacy) don't mind, but
GabrielRavier does.
