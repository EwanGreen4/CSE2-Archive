<h1 align="center">CSE2 Master Archive</h1>
Archive of all notable CSE2 forks. Includes source code and available binaries. Assume the latest version for sources. Binaries are labelled by version number if it is known.

Pull requests are more than welcome for missing versions (i.e. missing forks of CSE2 or builds for a specific platform), of which there are many. As a matter of fact, pull requests are preferred over issues in most cases, due to the fact that most of the relevant issues that can be made are better made in the form of a pull request (missing forks!).
